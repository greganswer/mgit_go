#       Title: Update README file
mgit branch JIR-642

```

## Development

**NOTE:** The following is subject to change:

```
$ go run main.go help
run Git work flows for GitHub with issue tracking ticket numbers

Usage:
  mgit [command]

Available Commands:
  branch      Create a branch using issue ID and title
  commit      Create a commit and push to GitHub
  help        Help about any command
  init        Initialize local repository and push to remote

  pr          Create a GitHub Pull Request for the specified branch

Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.mgit.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for mgit

Use "mgit [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Add a new command

New commands can be generated by doing the following:

    cobra add <commandName>

Example: `cobra add server` -> resulting in a new `cmd/server.go` file.

See the [Cobra add command](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/cobra/README.md) for more info.

### Style guide

**General**
- Ensure that args or flags can always be provided to bypass user prompts
- Stdout should be used for all output and stderr for warning and errors

**Command descriptions**
- Description should be concise, in lowercase, and do not end in a period

**Flags**
- Are preferred to arguments
- Description should be concise, in lowercase, and do not end in a period

**Colors**
- Too many contrasting colors can distract users
- Yellow and red should be used warning and error messages
- Color can be disabled by adding --no-color, setting COLOR=false, or when the output is not a tty.
